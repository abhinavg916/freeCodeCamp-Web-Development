# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Notes
## Important Points
### Basic JavaScript: Declare JavaScript Variables Passed
* In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

### Basic JavaScript: Understanding Uninitialized Variables
* When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

### Basic JavaScript: Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
* Best Practice - The variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

### Basic JavaScript: Declare String VariablesPassed
*  String is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

### Basic JavaScript: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
* In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (`\`) in front of the quote.

### Basic JavaScript: Find the Length of a String
* The length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

### Basic JavaScript: Understand String Immutability
* In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

### Basic JavaScript: Nest one Array within Another Array
* You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:
```
[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]
```
### Basic JavaScript: Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
* One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example
```
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11
```
* Note - There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

### Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With push()
* An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

`.push()` takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

Examples:
```
var arr1 = [1,2,3];
arr1.push(4);
// arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]
```

### Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With pop()
* Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

`.pop()` is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

* Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.
```
var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]
```

### Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With shift()
* pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Example:
```
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
// removedFromOurArray now equals "Stimpson" and ourArray now equals ["J", ["cat"]].
```

### Basic JavaScript: Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
* Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

Example:
```
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
ourArray.unshift("Happy");
// ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]
Add ["Paul",35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().
```

### Basic JavaScript: Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.


### Basic JavaScript: Passing Values to Functions with ArgumentsPassed
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun: testFun("Hello", "World"); We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

### Basic JavaScript: Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

Using var, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword.

### Basic JavaScript: Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // logs "foo"
console.log(loc); // loc is not defined
loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still have 'ReferenceError: myVar is not defined', but this will not cause the tests to fail.

### Basic JavaScript: Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

var someVar = "Hat";
function myFun() {
  var someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with "sweater".

### Basic JavaScript: Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

var sum = 0;
function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}
addSum(3); // sum will be modified but returned value is undefined
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

### Basic JavaScript: Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

```
function nextInLine(arr, item) {
  // Only change code below this line
  arr.push(item);
  return arr.shift();
  // Only change code above this line
  

}

// Setup
var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5];

// Display code
console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 6));
console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
```

### Add === Operator

### Basic JavaScript: Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

### Basic JavaScript: Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
* Switch Cases comparision in JavaScript uses strictly `===` comparision operator
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}
can be replaced with:

switch(val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}

### asic JavaScript: Returning Boolean Values from Functions
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

function isEqual(a,b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

function isEqual(a,b) {
  return a === b;
}

### Basic JavaScript: Build JavaScript ObjectsPassed
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};

### Basic JavaScript: Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2

The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
