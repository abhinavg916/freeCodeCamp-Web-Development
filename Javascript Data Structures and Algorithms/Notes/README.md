# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Notes
## Important Points
### Basic JavaScript: Declare JavaScript VariablesPassed
* In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

### Basic JavaScript: Understanding Uninitialized Variables
* When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

### Basic JavaScript: Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
* Best Practice - The variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

### Basic JavaScript: Declare String VariablesPassed
*  String is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

### Basic JavaScript: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
* In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (`\`) in front of the quote.

### Basic JavaScript: Find the Length of a String
* The length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

### Basic JavaScript: Understand String Immutability
* In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
