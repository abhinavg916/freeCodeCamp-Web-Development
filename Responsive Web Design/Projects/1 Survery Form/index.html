      <p class="bold">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</p>

          - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
          Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food
          changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."

          - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
          cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study
          under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.

          <span class="bold">1941 </span>
          - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
          is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof
          glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
          science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1942 </span>
          - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology

          <span class="bold">1944 </span>
          - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
          pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
          program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
          strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for
          each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1945 </span>

        <li>
          <span class="bold">1953 </span>
          - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
          American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It
          goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1962 </span>
          - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the
          Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a
          rapidly expanding population.
        </li>
        <li>

          sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">1984 </span>

          <span class="bold">2005 </span>
          - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
          Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet
          the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
          inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants
          and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people
          were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">2009 </span>
